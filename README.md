# supported [![CI](https://github.com/supportedjs/supported/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stefanpenner/supported/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Usage

```sh
npx supported <path/to/node_module>
npx supported <[array/of/node_modules]>
```

#### Optional Flags

The `--current-date` (`-c`) flag enables a form of limited time travel, and attempts to run
the tools internal date calculations based on a specified date, rather then the
current date.

Some examples:

* `--current-date="March 31, 2011"` runs the tool as if it was March 31, 2021
* `--current-date="-3 weeks"` runs the tool as if it was 3 weeks ago
* `--current-date="3 weeks"` runs the tool as if it was 3 weeks from now

The date micro-syntax is described as:

Anything that `new Date(input)` parses, or if that fails it will assume to be a
relative duration starting today parsed by
[parse-duration@^1.0.0's own micro-syntax](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration#available-unit-types-are).

##### --config-file
The `--config-file`(`-f`) enables to provide a path to the config file with the configurations mentioned [here](./CONFIGURATION.md).
```
// config.json
{
  "custom": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["es6-promise", "rsvp"],
      "effectiveReleaseDate": "Dec 10 2022",
      "upgradeBudget": {
        "major": 4,
        "minor": 4,
        "patch": 4
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### As a node module


```js
const { processPolicies } = require('supported');
const projectPaths = ['test/fixtures/unsupported-project', 'test/fixtures/supported-project' ];
const jsonResult = await processPolicies(projectPaths);
const projectPaths_2 = 'test/fixtures/unsupported-project';
const jsonResult_2 = await processPolicies(projectPaths_2);
```
